# Starter Guide to Landing a Tech Internship :smile:
Hi! I'm Erick and welcome to my starter guide for landing a tech internship. As a note, this document isn't a comprehensive step-by-step formula for becoming employed. Rather, this guide will give you direction for where to look when job searching and aspiring to become a professional software engineer. For each section, I'll give an overview of advice to always keep in mind and possibly link some documents, articles, and forums that can answer any  questions you may have. 
# The Tech Industry in General
Technology is a staple of societal development and a constant in human life. As such, tech evolves in a way that makes the demand for technologists ever-increasing. There's hundreds of thousands of companies looking for software developers in order to continually adapt to modern-day needs. Think of any company you regularly interact with. That company hires software engineers. Walmart, Shell, McDonalds, Bank of America, etc. With so many companies in search of engineers, what does the landscape look like for a student trying to find their first job?
## Types of Software Companies
We'll first talk about the different types of software companies. 
### Non-Software
Non-software based companies use software to improve their customer's experience through tech. These include companies such as Target, McDonalds, and other large corporations. Software engineers aren't the core of their business but are very necessary. While I wouldn't recommend these companies as prime environments for growing as an engineer, they offer unique perspectives on how software can be integrated into non-software industries. Salaries for these companies can be competitive but the benefits as a software engineer aren't as nice as software-based companies.
### FAANG
The infamous acronym: FAANG(Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). While those five companies make up the acronym, FAANG represents any large corporation that is based almost entirely on software. These companies can be very competitive for landing internships but the reward is worthwhile. Additionally, FAANG offers some of the best benefits, name recognition, and salaries available in the industry. However, these companies can also leave software engineers stressed from too much work and make engineers feel as a "cog in the machine". Meaning, an engineer can become overworked and feel undervalued while working for large companies. This experience varies case-by-case but be aware of these working conditions.
### Unicorns/Mid-Sized Software Companies
Unicorns are startups with valuations of over 1 billion dollars. This category includes companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Robinhood. Unicorns and other mid-sized companies provide the opportunity for interns/engineers to make meaningful contributions. They practice similar software development methodologies to large companies and provide the same room for growth for an engineer. While name recognition may not be on the same level as FAANG, salaries can be on par/slightly below those of the top companies.
### Startups
Startups are companies who are finding their legs and just starting to grow their business. Depending on what stage of funding the startup is at, startups can offer a wide variety of salaries for interns. There is tons of room to grow as an engineer since you will need to push out features and software on the company's urgent schedule. Name recognition may be close to non-existent but these companies can provide lots of opportunities for an engineer to climb the corporate ladder.
## Locations
Let's discuss the biggest hot spots for tech companies and where some industries are starting to find their footing.
### HCOL
High cost-of-living cities for engineers include: San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York, Seattle, San Diego, and Los Angeles. These cities are where large tech companies have planted their base and are hiring engineers. Due to the high cost-of-living, these cities also offer some of the biggest salaries for engineers.
### MCOL
Medium cost-of-living cities are great for affordable housing and potentially high salaries. Cities include: Austin, Atlanta, Denver, DC, and Raleigh. Boston is a city with similar tech markets as other cities in this category but with the cost of living as an HCOL company. These cities offer salaries that are slightly below those of HCOL cities but with the downside of less touristy attractions.
### LCOL

Iâ€™m personally unfamiliar with tech scenes in these kinds of cities.
# Finding Your Interests
Within tech, there are lots of different fields that require software engineers. I'll give you a list of some of the most popular positions and a brief description of what they do. Look more into each position and decide for yourself if you want to pursue these fields.
#### Frontend
Frontend development focuses on implementing the look of a website and the mechanisms that allow the user to interact with the website. Frontend developers create the look of a website.
#### Backend
Backend development is a blanket term for software fields that aren't visible to the user. This includes network engineering, software infrastructure, OS development, and more. Backend development is also not entirely restricted to supporting websites.
#### Fullstack
Full stack developers work with both the frontend and backend of a product. Thus, they need to be familiar with how the two fields interact and integrate.
#### DevOps
Developer operation engineers help build the pipelines and production environments that make it possible for software developers to push out features on multiple platforms. These positions offer less opportunity to code.
#### AI
Artificial Intelligence is a field that focuses on equipping technology with humanistic learning. Fields like natural language processing and machine learning come from AI and have helped with technologies like self driving cars, Siri, and smart home devices.
#### Data Science
This field focuses on analyzing data to develop useful conclusions. Data science can oftentimes work with mind-boggling sets of data, both structured and unstructured.
#### UX/UI
User experience and user interaction is a field that focuses on human and technology interactions. UX/UI wants to develop the best customer experience by studying the best techniques for user interactions.
# Application Process
Whether you've found the path you want to pursue or are still unsure, knowing how the application process works for the tech industry can allow you to prepare wisely. 
## Where to Apply
A big question you may ask yourself is where do I even apply. Sure, you could look up "software engineer internships" on Google and apply to all of the ones you see. However, Google has the tendency to just route you to the websites where companies are posting jobs. Instead, let's take a look at the websites themselves. These websites make it easier for the applicant because they can find the jobs they want all on the same page. 

- **LinkedIn** - LinkedIn is a popular social networking site for professionals. Companies take advantage of the site's popularity by posting positions on the website's "Job" section. This is the site I personally use for applying to positions.
- **Indeed** - Indeed has been in the job search business for a long time and is a great platform for companies to post their openings. The user interface isn't the best but the abundance of job postings balances out the website's design.
- **Handshake** - Handshake markets themselves as a job board entirely dedicated to students. While growing, the company has gathered an impressive number of job postings.
- **Jumpstart** - Jumpstart is a similar platform to Handshake but offers a student forum feature all on the same website. The forums are a space for students to post questions and engage in conversation with other tech students. Jumpstart even has a section for virtual career webinars.
## How it Works
Let's review how the application process typically works. You, the applicant, submit an application to the company for it to be reviewed. If the company likes your application, they will invite you to interview. We'll take a closer look at interviews in a later section. If all goes well, the company will reach out to you with their offer to join the company! In this section, I want to focus on two common ways your application is reviewed.
### ATS
ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. An ATS helps make a recruiter's job easier by pre-filtering resumes before sending them to a human recruiter. These systems scan an applicants resume and look for keywords. If a resume has an acceptable number of keywords and skill sets, that resume moves on to be reviewed by a human recruiter. Thus, the wording in a resume or application can make a huge difference when moving along the application process. Just make sure you don't stuff your resume with keywords to the point where it's nonsensical. It's worth noting that ATS' do more than filter resumes but those extra features are logistical benefits to the recruiter that don't affect how your application is evaluated. 
### Human Reviewers
While some companies use a combination of ATS and human reviewers, other companies solely use human reviewers. This works to your benefit because the reviewer has the opportunity to review your application regardless of the number of buzzwords on your resume.
##  Building a Resume
We mentioned resumes in the previous section, now let's take a look at some topics that people are frequently curious about. To start off, be aware that experience in the industry goes above all else when applying to software engineering roles.
### GPA
Unless you plan on going to grad schools, GPAs don't matter as much as you'd think they do. Companies evaluate a candidate based on their ability to do the job. While GPA offers a good look at how well a student can absorb knowledge, projects and experience are better indicators of how passionate a student is for building software. As such, most companies won't even ask for you GPA at any point along the application process. That being said, some companies do use GPA as a preliminary filter so staying above a 3.0 or 3.2 is a safe bet.
### Personal Projects
Since this is a guide to landing an internship, I won't expect you to already have an internship under your belt. The next best thing? Personal projects. In this case, personal projects can refer to any research or fun applications you may have built. Adding a description of a sizable personal project allows your passion to shine through to recruiters. If you don't have any projects, don't fret! Now's a great time to start. Some great places to look: [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), [Happy Coding](https://happycoding.io/), and [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/). 

Looking up tutorials on YouTube is also a great way to figure out how things work. Searching phrases like ["How to build a chat app"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+build+a+chat+app) can give you a step-by-step guide on building your first personal projects. Once you've followed enough tutorials you'll be ready to take your skills and create something on your own. 
### Cold Emails
A cold email is an email that's sent to a recruiter that you don't know. Done right, these can be an effective way to get your foot in the door at a company. [Nick Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nipun-singh/) shared with me [this](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/11fa1ee9c20a64044db2d61ba/files/fb9665b4-5a23-4d17-ab6e-64287cb66ad8/Cold_Email_Tips_To_Land_Your_Dream_Job.pdf) guide to sending cold emails. I've seen cold emails go a long way for other students trying to get into their dream company. Don't be scared to send these emails. At the worst, you'll receive a rejection via email. At best, you've got your foot in the door and can being interviewing!
### Digital Presence
Digital presence is centered around how easily accessible you and your accomplishments are on the internet. When people search your name, a digital presence makes it easier for someone to get to know you. Various platforms can be great for providing more information on who you are. For example, I use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-dolores/) to make my background and experience more available to the public. Recruiters can find out where I attend school, where I've worked, and what my objectives are. [Personal websites](http://www.erickdolores.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) are also great for professional and personal reasons. While they may not be a deal breaker for recruiters, a personal website can offer an intimate/personal perspective on who you are as a person. Therefore, websites cam expand your network by allowing users to reach out to you if they liked what they saw on your site. [Github](https://github.com/edolores)
is a code hosting service that allows recruiters to actually dive into your code and see physical proof of your passion. Github accounts are always a plus because they provide insight into how you write code. 
### Cover Letters
Unless you're applying for a financial firm or old-fashioned company, cover letters aren't a necessity. Recruiters have to sift through thousands of resumes and applications to fill up only a couple of spots. Cover letters create more work for a recruiter and aren't always appreciated. It's best to focus on your resume and insure that it effectively communicates your interests and your skill set.

# Interviewing
The number of interviews and their contents varies from company to company. Interviews may require you to solve coding questions within an hour-long timeframe. Others will be entirely behavioral or will have you complete an application beforehand. Sometimes the company will pay for you to fly out to a new city to interview in-person! Here are the two main categories for interviewing.
## Behavioral
## Technical
ctci, interviewing.io, leetcode 
# Freshman and Sophomores
### Programs
uber, google, facebook, ea, code2040, new technologists
### Internships
